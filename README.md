# JWT Sample Tutorial

This is a simple tutorial that demonstrates how to use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization in a web application.

## Overview

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a compact and self-contained way to represent information between two parties. In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

1. Generate JWTs on the server.
2. Authenticate users using JWTs.
